# For Red Academy - Angular2 repository based upon minimalES6-v01

This repo is used for the Angular2 section of the Red Academy Web Dev
Course. It's based upon the minimalES6-V01 repo I created at

https://github.com/eapostol/minimalES6-v01.git

In addition, this repo attempts to merge the typeScript repo
mentioned in the slides, at 

https://github.com/Codesleuth/vscode-typescript-boilerplate


THIS GIT URL is at https://github.com/eapostol/ra_angular02_v01 

To use this repo:

1. Create a repo for your github profile, call it ra_angular02_v01.
2. For the description, enter in any details such as "angular2 starter"
3. Do not add a README or license.

Then

4. In your terminal / command prompt, create a folder that will host 
the local copy of the repo files, calling it ra_angular02_v01 or 
something that makes sense.
5. Then enter the following in your terminal / command prompt

git clone https://github.com/eapostol/ra_angular02_v01.git ra_angular02_v01

(assuming you are in a directory above the newly created ra_angular02_v01)

6. use the cd command to enter into the ra_angular02_v01 folder

cd ra_angular02_v01

7. Then at the terminal / command prompt, run **npm install**
This should create the node_modules folder and add the packages.

8. You can then begin to install the Angular02 package and follow
 the instructions as per the slides :)
 
 hint: you may wish to make a branch called work in progress, separate
 from your master, so that your changes won't corrupt the "master"
 branch per se.
 

 
 Good luck :)
